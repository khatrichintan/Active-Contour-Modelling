Abstract - In this project, our goal is to detect objects in medical images whose boundaries may or may not be distinctly defined. In the problem definition evolving the active contour, would stop on the desired boundary. For efficient object detection, we extract the texture and shape of medical images automatically using edge detection which is widely used in image segmentation. The active contour reaching the desired boundary i.e., the stopping condition does not depend on the gradient of the image, but is instead related to a particular segmentation of the image. Also, the initial curve can be anywhere in the image, and interior contours are automatically detected. Medical images plat a very important role in detection of tumors, illnesses and abnormalities, due to the swift expansion in digital medical images; a need has risen for efficient algorithms to detect a region of interest in medical images. Such a system would provide great assistance to doctors in medical diagnosis.
